This repo is provided simply to provide stable, versioned access to this publicly available dataset to enable more easy programatic consumption - I make no claim to own the data.

At time of writing, the most recent entry has a registration date of 2019-02-15.

I indent to update this dataset from time to time, but there is currently no automated process for this.  Please submit an issue if you see that the file is out of date.
